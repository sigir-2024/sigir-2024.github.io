								<strong>Link to:</strong> <a href="#integration"><strong>SIGIR 2024 Integration Procedure and Deadlines</strong></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								We warmly congratulate all authors on the acceptance of your paper. We kindly ask for your
								attention to the following message, as it contains important details that require your action
								and cooperation to ensure the success of the upcoming in-person conference.
							</p>
							<p>
								SIGIR 2024 is an in-person conference. We believe that an in-person conference is beneficial
								for several reasons: it fosters direct engagement and networking opportunities, enhances the
								exchange of research ideas, contributes to a more dynamic and productive conference experience,
								and nurtures our research community by welcoming newcomers, providing them with the opportunity
								to become acquainted with SIGIR traditions. This decision has not been made lightly. We
								understand the challenges it may pose in the aftermath of a pandemic and amidst the uncertainties
								of the world around us. We are implementing measures such as proxy presenters, live streaming
								the keynotes, and recording technical oral sessions to ensure everyone has access to the
								conference's valuable content and to enable the widespread dissemination of Information
								Retrieval research to a global audience.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Presentation format:
							</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Full Papers: 15 minutes oral presentation + 3 minutes Q/A</li>
								<li>Perspective Papers: 15 minutes oral presentation + 3 minutes Q/A</li>
								<li>Reproducibility Papers: 15 minutes oral presentation + 3 minutes Q/A</li>
								<li>Resource Papers: 5 minutes oral presentation (no Q/A) + poster in SIGIR 2024 Poster Session</li>
								<li>Short Papers: poster in SIGIR 2024 Poster Session</li>
								<li>Demo Papers: table for demonstration + poster in SIGIR 2024 Poster Session</li>
								<li>TOIS Papers: 15 minutes oral presentation + 3 minutes Q/A</li>
								Other SIGIR content (DC Papers, workshops/tutorials, SIRIP papers): instructions for presentations in these tracks are provided by the relevant Track Chairs</li>
							</ul>

							<br>
	                        <h3 class="margin-bottom-5"><strong>Main Conference Oral Presentation Format</strong></h3>

							<ul>
								<li>All accepted papers for oral presentations at the main conference are expected to be
									presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper
									will attend the conference in person to present the paper and address audience questions
									during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted.</li>
								<li>Please wait for further communication from the PC chairs regarding whether your paper
									will be presented orally.</li>
								<li>All technical oral presentations, including Q&A, will be recorded by our AV technical
									team and uploaded to the ACM SIGIR'24 YouTube Channel, with the consent from the
									presenters. This will enable the widespread dissemination of your research to a worldwide
									audience, ensuring a long-lasting impact of your research. Please be prepared to be
									on camera and on YouTube. </li>
								<li>The duration of Oral Presentation will be communicated later. Stay tuned. </li>
								<li>In exceptional cases, if authors are unable to attend in person, they must designate
									a proxy presenter who will or has registered for the conference. Registered authors
									may also have the option to present remotely from the proxy's laptop, with the proxy
									presenter attending the session in person. If the authors cannot present the work for
									any unforeseen reason, the proxy presenter will present the work to the audience. It
									is the authors' responsibility to select a qualified proxy presenter and confirm their
									understanding of the paper’s technical content. We urge the authors to plan ahead and
									allocate ample time to find and rehearse with their proxy presenters. Please note that
									even if a proxy presenter presents the paper at the conference, at least one author
									of the paper must register for the conference. The proxy presenter must also be a
									registered attendee of the conference.</li>
								<li>To help us gather the necessary information about your oral or proxy presentations,
									please carefully review the conference's Integration Procedure (in the “SIGIR 2024
									Integration Procedure and Deadlines” section of this email) and the deadlines for each
									step in the Integration Procedure.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3 class="margin-bottom-5"><strong>Main Conference Poster Presentation Format</strong></h3>

							<ul>
								<li>All accepted papers for poster presentation at the main conference are expected to be
									presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper
									will attend the conference in person to present the poster and address audience
									questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted.</li>
								<li>Please wait for further communication from the PC chairs regarding whether your paper
									will be presented as a poster. </li>
								<li>Poster presentations will not be video recorded. Our AV technical team will not capture
									these sessions. </li>
								<li>The dates, duration, poster dimension, and other details for Poster Presentation will
									be communicated later. Stay tuned. </li>
								<li>In exceptional cases, if authors are unable to attend in person, they must designate
									a proxy presenter who has registered for the conference. Registered authors may also
									have the option to present remotely from the proxy's laptop or mobile phone, with the
									proxy presenter attending the poster session in person. However, no power outlets will
									be provided during the poster sessions, except for the Demo Track papers. If the
									authors cannot present the work for any unforeseen reason, the proxy presenter will
									present the work to the audience. It is the authors' responsibility to select a
									qualified proxy presenter and confirm their understanding of the technical content.
									We urge authors to plan ahead and allocate ample time to find and rehearse with their
									proxy presenters. Please note that even if a proxy presenter presents the poster at
									the conference, at least one author of the poster must register for the conference.
									The proxy presenter must also be a registered attendee of the conference.</li>
								<li>To help us gather the necessary information about your poster or proxy presentations,
									please carefully review the conference's Integration Procedure (in the “SIGIR 2024
									Integration Procedure and Deadlines” section of this email) and the deadlines for each
									step in the Integration Procedure.</li>

								<li>Proxy Presenter Arrangement (By authors):<br>
									Deadline: June 22, 2024<br>
									<!--Remarks: Authors requiring proxy presenters must confirm their arrangements by the

									information in the form using the link of the first response.</li>
								<li>Integration Chairs Assistance Requests:<br>
									<!--Deadline: June 22, 2024<br>
									Remarks: Authors who have not yet secured a proxy presenter are encouraged to reach
									out to the Integration Chairs
									(<a href="emailto:SIGIR24-integration@acm.org">SIGIR24-integration@acm.org</a>) for
									assistance. However, this option should be considered a LAST resort. The Integration
									Chairs will make every effort to arrange proxy presenters from the same research
									track whenever possible.</li>-->
									As a last resort, in case of emergency contact the integration chairs directly by
									email to <a href="emailto:SIGIR24-integration@acm.org">SIGIR24-integration@acm.org</a>
									who will try to advise and help.

							<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
								SIGIR'24 will be held in Washington, D.C., United States. While visiting the United States
								can be straightforward for many attendees, others may require additional efforts to obtain

								please carefully review the requirements for a United States visitor visa and the U.S.
								Customs and Border Protection regulations:

							<p>The <a href="https://cvent.me/abKKBE">registration site</a> opened mid-October 2023 to give
								international attendees more time to secure a travel visa. However, due to a change in
								the conference venue, the registration site has been temporarily paused since March 7th,
								2024. This pause allows us to update our registration fee table, incorporate ICTIR
								registration, and introduce a new registration option: a day pass for Government Day
								(July 17, 2024) aimed at increasing local registrations. The registration site will
								reopen around April 4, and we will announce this on the conference website and the SIGIR
								Slack channel. Stay tuned for updates.
							</p>
							<p>
								New early registration deadline: May 15, 2024. <br>
								New standard registration deadline: June 15, 2024.
