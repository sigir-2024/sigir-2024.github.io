										<strong>Abstract:</strong>
										As the recent pace of AI innovation has increased, search and
										recommendation is being increasingly transformed in recent years. These
										transformations are fundamentally changing how people interact with
										search and recommendation experiences as well as how content is created.
										Understanding these trends is a key toward projecting the broader
										technology needs we anticipate in the future.  After reflecting on these
										broader trends we dive into three key advances that have already changed
										the landscape of search and recommendation: dense retrieval, augmented
										LLMs, and GNNs. We discuss how these technologies have impacted content
										understanding, conversational recommendation, and user modeling. Finally,
										we conclude with speculations on the technical challenges surrounding
										the more general landscape of AI and its implications for supporting
										personalization for both creators and the audience in search and
										recommendation. This talk presents work with many collaborators both
										past and present at Microsoft, Spotify, and more broadly in academia.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Bio:</strong>
										Paul Bennett is Director of Research on Large Language Models at Spotify.
										His research focuses on how AI foundational models can improve current
										creator and audience experiences as well as the role they can play in
										the next generation of experiences.  Previous to joining Spotify, Paul
										was Partner Research Manager for the Augmented Learning + Reasoning group
										at Microsoft Research. His published research has focused on a variety
										of topics surrounding the use of machine learning in information
										retrieval – including deep learning for ranking and retrieval, ensemble
										methods and the combination of information sources, calibration,
										consensus methods for noisy supervision labels, active learning and
										evaluation, supervised classification and ranking, crowdsourcing,
										behavioral modeling and analysis, and personalization. Some of his work
										has been recognized with awards at SIGIR, CHI, ECIR, and ACM UMAP
										including a SIGIR Test of Time Award in 2022.

										<strong>Abstract:</strong>
										Responsible AI (RAI) seeks basic guarantees of fairness, safety, privacy,
										robustness, controllability, explainability, transparency, and governance for
										traditional ML systems and generative AI systems.   With the Executive Order on
										the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,
										the NIST ISO 42001 standard, and the EU AI Act, RAI has become a central focus
										of the AI/ML product development cycle.  In this talk we provide an overview of
										the current practices for measuring and mitigating each RAI dimension and we
										discuss challenges in measuring RAI dimensions in generative IR systems.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Bio:</strong>
										Vanessa Murdock leads a research group in Amazon AWS AI/ML, whose focus is
										Responsible AI (bias/fairness, toxicity, privacy, robustness, transparency,
										safety). In addition to doing fundamental research in RAI topics, her team
										builds tools for assessing aspects of responsible AI, used in AWS Services such
										as Rekognition and Transcribe.  Prior to joining AWS, she led a science team in
										Alexa Shopping focused on recommender systems, search and HCI. Her team provided
										the machine learning that backed Amazon’s Choice, and Alexa Shopping List, in
										addition to contributing content moderation for the generative AI system Rufus.
										She was previously at Microsoft, working on location inference and notifications
										at Bing and Cortana. Prior to Microsoft, Murdock led the Geographic Context and
										Experience Group at Yahoo! Research in Barcelona, which centered on geographic
										information retrieval and user-generated content. She has been awarded 19
										patents, and has more than 20 patent applications pending, resulting in a Master
										Inventor Award from Yahoo! (2012). She received the OAA Award for Outstanding
										Achievement by a Young Alum from the University of Massachusetts in 2014. She is
										currently serving as the Chair of the ACM SIGIR Executive Committee. Murdock
										received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts
										Amherst Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval.

										<strong>Abstract:</strong>
										The IR community as a whole is considering whether search and recommendations can move entirely to embedding-based technologies. This SIRIP panel discusses the future of embedding-based technologies in industry search given its broad range of document types, its specific query types, its performance requirements, and the features that accompany search. The panel comprises long-time industry experts and academics with industry ties. The panelists vary as to whether they believe that the industry in practice will move entirely to embeddings or will remain a hybrid domain.
