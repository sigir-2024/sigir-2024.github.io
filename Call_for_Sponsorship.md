# Call for Sponshorship

On behalf of the Organizing Committee for the 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2024), we invite you to participate in the conference as a supporter or exhibitor.

The International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, annually attracts a thousand or more participants from industry and academia, with a common interest in search, recommendation, data mining, natural language processing, and related machine learning technologies. As a top-tier international conference affiliated with the main computer science professional organization, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), SIGIR is the gathering place for current and future leaders and innovators from all over the world to discuss and present the state of the art in connecting people with information. The conference location rotates among North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe.

Corporate sponsorship allows the conference registration fees to be kept as low as possible, especially for student attendees. both to promote attendance and to offset the cost of events and services. Your generosity will also help us expand SIGIR’s program and events. Supporting SIGIR activities is an excellent way to reach a targeted audience and talents. SIGIR is a privileged place to highlight your involvement in the increasingly important area of online and document searching and to reach students for potential employment opportunities.

We look forward to seeing you in Washington, D.C., USA in 2024!
