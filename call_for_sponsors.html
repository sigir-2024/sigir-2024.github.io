								year, SIGIR will also have an Award ceremony, an industry track (SIRIP), a government day,
								Large Language Model Day, various DEI events and social events, ranging from women in IR,
								student luncheon, student welcome party, and a formal banquet. The conference will be
								<strong>fully in-person</strong>. -->
								SIGIR is a major international forum for presentations of the latest state-of-the-art research
								and demonstration of new systems and methods for connecting people with information: from
								search engines, recommender systems, digital libraries, and social network technology to
								compelling applications in health, legal, educational, and other domains, research at SIGIR
								spans academia, industry, and government.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a top-tier international conference affiliated with the main computer science professional
								organization, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), SIGIR is attended by many of
								the world’s top researchers and practitioners who work in research areas that include
								information retrieval, recommendation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural
								language processing, human-computer interaction, and more. The ACM SIGIR Conference is the
								gathering place for current and future leaders and innovators from all over the world to
								discuss and present the state of the art in connecting people with information.
							</p>
							<p>
								The conference also hosts top Ph.D. students from the most prestigious institutions in
								computer and information science, and will host a number of events bringing together academia,
								industry, and public sectors.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our sponsorship options offer a range of different ways for you to become part of this
								amazing event. Apart from different sponsorship levels with tailored benefits we are also
								open to individual suggestions such as the sponsorship of specific sessions and social
								events.
